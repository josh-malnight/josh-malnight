Hello world!

I am a alt-academic (post-academic?) data scientist. I specialize in mixed models and time-series analyses, but have worked on many other projects. I am an aspiring Bayesian, but have not applied it as often as I would like. I am looking to engage those areas, especially in areas like clustering where probability can be absent. I have extensive experience in R, but am developing my Python skills as well. 

I am working on implementing Bayesian structural time-series models in Stan that can be customized with a few profitable bells and whistles.
